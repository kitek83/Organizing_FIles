In this chapter I learnt the following automated operations:
1.Making copies of all PDF files in every subfolder of a folder.
2.Removing the leading zeros in the filenames for every file in a folder of hundreds of files named
  spam001.txt, spam002.txt, spam003,txt.
3.Compressing contents of several folders into one ZIP file (which could be a simple backup system).
Files are not described properly due to lack of time. Folder will be updated soon.
